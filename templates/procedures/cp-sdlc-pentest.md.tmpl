### Penetration Testing

#### External Penetration Testing

An external penetration testing is performed at least once a year by a qualified
security researcher / ethical hacker on the security team internally and/or with
an external security consulting firm.

#### Continuous Penetration Testing via Public Vulnerability Disclosure / Bug Bounty Program

All technology contains bugs, including both functional defects and security
vulnerability.

{{companyShortName}} uses a third party platform to maintain a public
vulnerability disclosure / bug bounty program.  This program takes advantage of
crowd-sourced security researchers to perform penetration testing of
{{companyShortName}}'s platform and its public facing resources.

The current program provider is {{provider}}.
