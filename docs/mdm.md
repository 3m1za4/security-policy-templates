# Mobile Device Security and Storage Media Management

`2020.1`

 recognizes that media containing ePHI may be reused when appropriate
steps are taken to ensure that all stored ePHI has been effectively rendered
inaccessible. Destruction/disposal of ePHI shall be carried out in accordance
with federal and state law. The schedule for destruction/disposal shall be
suspended for ePHI involved in any open investigation, audit, or litigation.

ePHI.

## Policy Statements

 policy requires that:

(a) All media, including mobile and removable media, storing  company
data must be encrypted.

(b) Critical data as defined in [ data classification model
Â§data-management](data-mgmt.md), including but not limited to ePHI, may not be
stored on mobile devices or removable media such as USB flash drives.

(c) All destruction/disposal of ePHI media will be done in accordance with

## Controls and Procedures


### Media Disposal Process

IT and Security is responsible to ensure media containing critical / sensitive
data (such as ePHI) is disposed securely in the following manner:

* The methods of destruction, disposal, and reuse are reassessed periodically,
  based on current technology, accepted practices, and availability of timely
  and cost-effective destruction, disposal, and reuse technologies and services.
  This may include

    - Secure wipe;
    - Physical destruction;
    - Destruction of encryption keys (if the data on the media is encrypted
      using a strong algorithm such as AES-256).

* If the records have been requested in the course of a judicial or
  administrative hearing, a qualified protective order will be obtained to
  ensure that the records are returned to the organization or properly
  destroyed/disposed of by the requesting party.

* All  Subcontractors provide that, upon termination of the contract,
  they will return or destroy/dispose of all patient health information. In
  cases where the return or destruction/disposal is not feasible, the contract
  limits the use and disclosure of the information to the purposes that prevent
  its return or destruction/disposal.

*  In the cases of a  Customer terminating a contract with  and
   no longer utilize  Services, data will be returned or disposed per
   contract agreement or  Platform use terms and conditions. In all
   cases it is solely the responsibility of the  Customer to maintain
   the safeguards required of HIPAA once the data is transmitted out of 
   environments.


### Use of USB Flash Drive and External Storage Device

Per  corporate policy, confidential and critical data may
not be stored on external devices such as USB flash drives.  This includes and
is not limited to ePHI.  For definition of confidential and critical data, see
 Data Classification and Handling Policy.

Usage of USB flash drives for temporary transfer of confidential and critical
data may be allowed on a case by case basis, when the following process is
followed:

*   Data is only allowed on encrypted flash devices approved by 
    Security and the IT Manager (currently **IronKey**).
*   The process starts with the submission of a ticket in .
    The ticket must be approved by IT and Security.
*   Upon completion of data transfer all sensitive data on the device must be
    completely removed.
*   The device is to be returned to the IT Manager to double check that the data
    has been removed.
*   The IT Manager will check the drive back in.


### Support and Management of BYOD Devices

 provides company-issued laptops and workstations to all employees.



 currently does not require or support employees bringing their own
computing devices.

The end-user computing devices are self managed. Each  employee is
responsible to

* configure their laptop/workstation to meeting the [configuration and
  management requirements](ccm.md); and

* ensure the latest security patches are installed or auto-update is enabled.

IT and Security provides automated scripts for end-user system configurations
and/or technical assistance as needed.  Such configurations are audited daily
using **Jamf** centrally managed by the Security team.
